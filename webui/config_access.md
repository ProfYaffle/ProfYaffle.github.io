##Configuration - Access Entries

Setting up access control is an important initial step as **the system
initially is wide open**. 

When Tvheadend verifies access is scan through all the enabled access
control entries. The permission flags, streaming profiles, DVR config
profiles, channel tags are combined for all matching access entries. An
access entry is said to match if the username / password matches and the
IP source address of the requesting peer is within the prefix.

The access rules are listed / edited in a grid.

* To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it will
  flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
  changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the ‘Save
  changes’ button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only have to
  click once in it.

* To add a new entry, press the ‘Add entry’ button. The new (empty)
  entry will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled
  state. You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check
  the ‘enable’ box and then press ‘Save changes’ to activate the new
  entry.

* To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on
  them), and press the ‘Delete selected’ button. A popup will ask you
  to confirm your request.

Let’s also take a look at an example:

![Access Entries Example](docresources/accessconfigexample.png)

First line gives clients originating from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255
network access to streaming functions. Typically you would use this for
your local media players at home (All though Movian can prompt for
username & password in its HTSP client)

The second line adds a user with world wide access who might want to
modify recordings, etc, perhaps from the job, or mobile phone.

The third line provide admin access to the ‘admin’ user. As an extra
precaution this user is only allowed to log in from the home network.

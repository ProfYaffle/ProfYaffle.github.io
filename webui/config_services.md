    languages, etc.

**Enabled**
:   Whether or not this service is available for use

**Automatic Checking**

    this field will become as “Missing In PAT/SDT”. The check can be also
    disabled for given service using this column.

**Priority**
:   Define priority (range 0-10) for this service. The higher value means

**Service Name**
:   The name of the service, detected when the service was discovered

:   The locking mechanism selection for The Preferred Conditional Access
    Packet Identifier.

* **Off**
:   Automatic Preferred Conditional Access Packet Identifier selection.

* **On**

##Configuration - DVB Inputs - Muxes

Muxes are locations at which services can be found. On traditional
networks (DVB-C, -T and -S), these are carrier signals on which the
individual channels are multiplexed, hence the name. However, Tvheadend
also uses the term ‘mux’ to describe a source for multiple IP streams -
so an IP address, in effect.

####Buttons

The buttons have the following functions:

####Columns

The columns have the following functions:

**Play**:
Downloads a playlist file (M3U or XSPF, depending on your startup
options) so you can tune to the mux from an external application.

**Enabled**:
Whether or not the mux is enabled and thus available.

**EPG**:
EPG scan setup

  * **Disable**:
  Disable the EPG scan

  * **Enable (auto)**:
  Enable the EPG scan (when some services from this mux are assigned to
channels)

  * **Force (auto)**:
  Force the EPG scan (everytime when the EPG scan is triggered)

  * **Only EIT**:
  Do only EIT EPG scan (when some services from this mux are assigned to
channels)

  * **Only UK Freesat**:
  Do only UK Freesat EPG scan (when some services from this mux are
assigned to channels)

  * **Only UK Freeview**:
  Do only UK Freeview EPG scan (when some services from this mux are
assigned to channels)

  * **Only Viasat Baltic**:
  Do only Viasat Baltic EPG scan (when some services from this mux are
assigned to channels)

  * **Only OpenTV Sky UK**:
  Do only OpenTV Sky UK EPG scan (the TSID must match in the skyuk
configuration file)

  * **Only OpenTV Sky Italia**:
  Do only OpenTV Sky Italia EPG scan (the TSID must match in the skyit
configuration file)

  * **Only OpenTV Sky Ausat**:
  Do only OpenTV Sky Ausat EPG scan (the TSID must match in the ausat
configuration file)

**Network**:
The name of the network to which the mux belongs. Networks are defined
in Configuration -\> DVB Inputs -\> Networks - DVB-S or ATSC, for
example.

**Original Network ID**:
The ONID is a code which uniquely identifies a network.

**Transport Stream ID**:
The TSID is a code which identifies the network origination source or
transmitter.

**CRID Authority**:
The group responsible for the Content Reference Identifier for this mux. This is effectively a URL/URI to an authoritative source for programme
data (e.g. series link).

**Scan Status**:
Whether the mux is being scanned (ACTIVE), is planned to be scanned
(PEND) or has reverted to idle scan (IDLE).

**Scan Result**:
Whether there were any problems with the last scan of this mux.

**URL**:
Mux URL.

* **udp://**:
  Raw MPEG-TS UDP packets

* **rtp://**:
  MPEG-TS UDP packets with RTP header

* **http://**:
  HTTP stream (MPEG-TS)

* **https://**:
  Secure HTTP stream (MPEG-TS)

* **pipe://**:
  Read standard output from an external program. If the program name does
not have the first character ‘/’, the PATH environment variable is used
to find the program name in all directories specified by PATH.
Additional arguments may be separated using spaces. A raw MPEG-TS stream
is expected. The string \${service\_name} is substituted with the
service name field contents. The \\ (backslash) character means “take
the next character as-is” (usually space or the backslash itself.

**\# Services**:
The number of services found on this mux.

**Character Set**:
The character encoding for this mux (e.g. UTF-8).

**PMT Descriptor 0x06 = AC-3**:
Whether or not the empty PMT descriptor 0x06 defaults to the AC-3
stream. Some Chinese cable providers are using this. If unsure, keep
this off.

**Interface**:
IPTV : the network interface/card on which the IPTV source can be found.

**ATSC**:
whether or not this is an ATSC IPTV source.

**Priority**:
IPTV : The mux priority value (higher value = higher priority to use
services from this mux). Value 0 means use the IPTV network priority
value.

**Streaming Priority**:
IPTV : The mux priority value for streamed channels through HTTP or HTSP
(higher value = higher priority to use services from this mux). Value 0
means use the standard streaming network priority value.

**Environment (pipe)**:
IPTV : List of environment variables for pipe (like PATH=/bin:/sbin)
separated by spaces. The backslash character is handled like in URL.

**Respawn (pipe)**:
IPTV : Respawn the executed process when it dies.

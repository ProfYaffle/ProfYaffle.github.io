####DVR Behaviour

**Media container**
:   Select the container format used to store recordings.

**Cache scheme**
:   Select the cache scheme used to store recordings. Leave as “system”
    unless you have a special case for one of the others.
    
 Whenever you read or write data to the filesystems, the information
 is kept (cached) in memory for a while. This means that
 regularly-access files are available quickly without going back to
 the disc; it also means that there’s a disconnect when writing
 between the write request (from the application) and the actual
 write itself (to the disc/storage) as changes are buffered to be
 written in one go.

**Unknown**
:   A placeholder status, meaning that the configuration isn’t properly
    set.

**System**
:   Change nothing and rely on standard (default) system caching to
    behave as it normally would.

**Do not keep**
:   Tell the system that you’re not expecting to re-use the data soon,
    so don’t keep it in cache. The data will still be buffered for
    writing. *Useful e.g. in a RAM-limited system like a Pi (given that
    you’re unlikely to be watching while recording, so data can be
    discarded now and read back from disc later).*

**Sync**
:   Tell the system to write the data immediately. This doesn’t affect
    whether or not it’s cached. *Useful e.g. if you’ve a particular
    problem with data loss due to delayed write (such as if you get
    frequent transient power problems).*

**Sync + Do not keep**
:   A combination of last two variants above - data is written
    immediately and then discarded from cache.

**DVR Log retention time (days)**
:   Time that Tvheadend will keep information about the recording in its
    internal database. Notice that the actual recorded file will not be
    deleted when the log entry is deleted.

**Extra time before recordings (minutes)**
:   Specify the number of minutes to record before the events scheduled
    start time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.

**Extra time after recordings (minutes)**
:   Specify the number of minutes to record after the events scheduled stop
    time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.

**Episode duplicate detection**
:   If checked, broadcasts with matching title and matching non-zero episode
    number are considered duplicates.

**EPG update window**
:   Maximum difference between event start times when the EPG event is
    changed. TVHeadend uses a fuzzy match logic (using title, start times,
    duration, episode) to check when the event was changed.

**Post-processor command**
:   Command to run after finishing a recording. The command will be run in
    background and is executed even if a recording is aborted or an error
    occurred. Use the %e error formatting string to check for errors, the
    error string is “OK” if recording finished successfully.
    
 Supported format strings:
 
  Format  | Description                               | Example value
  ------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------
  %f      | Full path to recording                    |  /home/user/Videos/News.mkv
  %b      | Basename of recording                     |  News.mkv
  %c      | Channel name                              |  BBC world
  %C      | Who created this recording                |  user
  %t      | Program title                             |  News
  %d      | Program description                       |  News and stories…
  %e      | Error message                             |  Aborted by user
  %S      | Start time stamp of recording, UNIX epoch |  1224421200
  %E      | Stop time stamp of recording, UNIX epoch  |  1224426600

 Example usage: `/path/to/ffmpeg -i %f -vcodec libx264 -acodec copy
“/path/with white space/%b”`

 You need to use quotes or escape white spaces if you want white spaces
in an argument.

####Recording File Options

**Recording system path**
:   Path to where Tvheadend will write recorded events. If components of the
    path does not exist, Tvheadend will try to create them.

**File permissions**
:   The permissions to be set on the resultant recording files.

This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under a
different user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.

Common examples:

Mode | Permissions
-----|------------
0644 | rw-r–r–
0664 | rw-rw-r– (default)
0666 | rw-rw-rw-

Note that the applicable umask applies, so 0666 with umask 0022 will
produce 0644 (rw-r–r–). See also *Directory permissions* in
*Subdirectory Options*.

**Filename charset**
:   Character set for the created filename. Tvheadend will try to
    approximate characters to similarly looking ones.

**Tag files with metadata**
:   If checked, media containers that support metadata will be tagged with
    the metadata associated with the event being recorded.

**Skip commercials**
:   If checked, commercials will be dropped from the recordings. At the
    moment, commercial detection only works for the swedish channel TV4.

---

####Subdirectory Options

**Directory permissions**
:   The permissions to be set on any sub-directories created for recordings.

This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under
a different user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.

Common examples:

Mode | Permissions
-----|------------
0755 | rwxr-xr-x
0775 | rwxrwxr-x (default)
0777 | rwxrwxrwx

Note that the applicable umask applies, so 0777 with umask 0022 will
produce 0755 (rwxr-xr-x). See also *File permissions* in *Recording File
Options*.

**Make sub-directories per day**
:   If checked, create a new directory per day in the recording system path.
    Only days when anything is recorded will be created. The format of the
    directory will be ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ (ISO standard)

**Make sub-directories per channel**
:   If checked, create a directory per channel when storing events. If both
    this and the ‘directory per day’ checkbox is enabled, the date-directory
    will be parent to the per-channel directory.

**Make sub-directories per title**
:   If checked, create a directory per title when storing events. If the
    day/channel directory checkboxes are also enabled, those directories
    will be parents of this directory.

####Filename Options


**Include channel name in title**
:   If checked, include the name of the channel in the event title. This
    applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name
    itself.

**Include date in title**
:   If checked, include the date for the recording in the event title. This
    applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name
    itself.

**Include time in title**
:   If checked, include the time for the recording in the event title. This
    applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name
    itself.

**Include episode in title**
:   If checked, include the season and episode in the title (if such info is
    available).

**Include subtitle in title**
:   If checked, include the episode subtitle in the title (if such info is
    available).

**Put episode in filename before date and time**
:   If checked, insert the episode number before the data and time rather
    than after (assumes *Include date*, *Include time* and *Include episode*
    options are set).

**Remove all unsafe characters from filename**
:   If checked, all characters that could possibly cause problems for
    filenaming will be replaced with ‘\_’.
    
Applies to characters:

* not supported by Windows: **/ : \\ < > | \* ? ’ \"**
* control characters (ASCII code below 32)
* control and national characters (ASCII code above 122)

**Replace whitespace in title with ‘-’**
:   If checked, whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) will be replaced
    with ‘-’.

**Use Windows-compatible filenames**
:   If checked:

* special characters not supported by Windows like: **/ : \\ \< \> | \*
? ’ "** will be replaced with ‘\_’
* trailing spaces ‘ ’ and dots ‘.’ will be removed

Changes to any of these settings must be confirmed by pressing the ‘Save
configuration’ button before taking effect.
